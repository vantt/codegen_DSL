# Designing DSL for GenAI-Powered Application Development

## Goal

The goal is to create two DSLs:

1.  **SDK Codex DSL:** A language to define the structure and components of a system.
2.  **Guide DSL:** A language to describe use cases and recipes for using the SDK defined by the SDK Codex DSL.

These DSLs will be used in a workflow that starts with app ideas, progresses to a high-level design, and then utilizes DSLs for detailed specifications before generating code.

## GenAI-Powered conversational application development process
1. App Ideas
2. High Level Design
3. Detail System Design using DSL(s)
4. Code generation using previous DSL

## Requirements

### SDK Codex DSL

*   Define various system components (modules, interfaces, data models, external services).
*   Express relationships between components (dependencies, inheritance, composition, associations).
*   Specify configuration parameters for components and the system.
*   Define constraints and rules governing system behavior.

### Guide DSL

*   Describe use case scenarios with step-by-step instructions, code examples, and expected outcomes.
*   Define reusable recipes or patterns for common tasks.
*   Provide context-specific information and guidance.

## Considerations

*   **GenAI Compatibility:** The DSLs should be easily understood by GenAI for code generation. This includes having a formal grammar, a well-defined Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and a rich set of examples.
*   **Existing DSLs:** While custom DSLs are being created, it's worth exploring existing DSLs like OpenAPI, RAML, and gRPC IDL for inspiration and potential integration.
*   **Tooling:**  Consider tools for parsing, code generation, editing, and documentation generation.
*   **User Experience:**  Make the DSLs user-friendly with clear syntax, helpful error messages, and good documentation.

## Examples

### SDK Codex DSL Example

```
system MyApplication {
  module UserManagement {
    interface UserService {
      method createUser(user: User): User
    }
    data model User {
      name: string
      email: string
    }
  }
  module ProductCatalog {
    // ...
  }
  dependency UserManagement -> ProductCatalog
}
```

### Guide DSL Example

```
usecase Create a new user {
  steps:
    1.  Obtain an instance of the UserService.
    2.  Create a new User object with the desired data.
    3.  Call the createUser() method on the UserService, passing the User object as an argument.
    4.  Verify that the returned User object has the expected properties.
}
```

## 4-Step AI-Powered Application Development Process

### Process Overview

A streamlined approach to developing applications using AI assistance and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).

### The 4 Steps

#### Step 1: App Ideas
##### Description
Initial phase where application concepts and requirements are gathered and defined.

##### Activities
- Brainstorming application concepts
- Gathering initial requirements
- Defining core features and functionality
- Identifying target users and use cases

##### Outputs
- App concept document
- Initial requirements list
- Core features list
- Target user profiles

#### Step 2: High-Level Design
##### Description
Architecture and system-level design phase using L1-DesignDSL.

##### Activities
- Defining system architecture
- Identifying core capabilities
- Specifying external system integrations
- Documenting non-functional requirements

##### Outputs
- L1-DesignDSL document capturing:
  - System boundaries
  - Core capabilities
  - Major data flows
  - Integration points
  - Non-functional requirements

#### Step 3: Detailed System Design
##### Description
Detailed component-level design phase using L2-SpecDSL.

##### Activities
- Designing system components
- Defining interfaces and data models
- Specifying component relationships
- Documenting configuration parameters

##### Outputs
- L2-SpecDSL document containing:
  - Component specifications
  - Interface definitions
  - Data models
  - Component relationships
  - System configurations

#### Step 4: Code Generation
##### Description
Implementation and code generation phase using L3-GuideDSL.

##### Activities
- Generating implementation code
- Creating usage documentation
- Developing implementation patterns
- Documenting best practices

##### Outputs
- Generated application code
- L3-GuideDSL document with:
  - Implementation guidelines
  - Usage patterns
  - Code examples
  - Best practices

### Process Flow
```
App Ideas → High-Level Design → Detailed System Design → Code Generation
   ↑              ↑                      ↑                     ↑
   |              |                      |                     |
   |         L1-DesignDSL          L2-SpecDSL           L3-GuideDSL
```
