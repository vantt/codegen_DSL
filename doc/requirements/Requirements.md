# Comprehensive DSL Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) system intended for use in a GenAI-powered application development workflow. The primary goals of this DSL system are to enable clear system design documentation, facilitate AI-driven processing, and ensure consistency across different levels of abstraction. These levels include L0-BaseDSL, L1-DesignDSL, L2-SpecDSL, and L3-ComponentUseDSL.

### 1.1. Purpose

This document serves as the central specification for all requirements related to the DSL system. It aims to provide a clear and concise description of the necessary features, functionalities, and qualities of the system.

### 1.2. Scope

These requirements encompass various aspects of the DSL system, including:

- Core language design principles and syntax rules applicable across all DSL levels.
- Processing and validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and correctness of DSL documents.
- Tooling and integration requirements to support developers in creating, managing, and utilizing DSLs.
- Specific requirements for enabling AI-driven processing of DSL documents.
- User experience considerations to ensure the DSLs are usable and effective for their intended audience.
- Guidelines and best practices for designing, implementing, and documenting DSLs.
- Quality attributes such as performance, reliability, and maintainability.

### 1.3. Document Conventions

The following conventions are used throughout this document:

- **SHALL**: Indicates a mandatory requirement.
- **SHOULD**: Indicates a recommended requirement.
- **MAY**: Indicates an optional requirement.

## 2. Core Principles and Requirements

### 2.1. Core Syntax Requirements (Applicable to All DSL Levels)

To ensure consistency, clarity, and machine-readability across all DSL levels, the following syntax requirements apply:

- **Consistency**: Syntax SHALL be consistent across all DSL levels. Common elements SHALL have a uniform representation, and naming conventions SHALL be standardized.
- **Readability**: Syntax SHALL be human-readable and writable. DSLs MUST support clear hierarchical structures and allow for comments and documentation.
- **Machine-Readability**: Syntax SHALL be easily parseable by AI systems and support deterministic parsing. Element boundaries MUST be clear.
- **Extensibility**: Syntax SHALL allow for future extensions and support versioning. Custom extensions MUST be enabled without breaking existing syntax.

### 2.2. Core DSL System Requirements

These requirements define the fundamental capabilities of the DSL system:

- **Language Design**: The DSL SHALL be simple for both human reading and AI processing. It SHALL support hierarchical structure representation, enable clear expression of design intent, provide type safety and validation, support extensibility and customization, enable modular composition, and support versioning and evolution.
- **AI Processing**: The DSL SHALL have unambiguous syntax for AI parsing and support deterministic processing. It SHALL enable automated validation and generation, support pattern recognition and relationship inference, provide clear structural boundaries, and enable context understanding.
- **User Experience**: The DSL SHALL be human-readable and writable, provide clear error messages, support intuitive navigation, and enable easy learning. It SHALL also support documentation, provide quick feedback, enable efficient editing, and support refactoring.
- **Technical Requirements**: The DSL SHALL support complex type systems, enable modular design, provide validation rules, support version control, and enable tool integration. It SHALL also support error recovery, enable performance optimization, and support scalability.
