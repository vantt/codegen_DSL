# L1-DesignDSL Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

L1-DesignDSL is a domain-specific language designed to capture high-level system design decisions, serving as the first formal step in translating application ideas into implementable systems. The DSL is specifically designed to be AI-compatible, enabling automated generation of high-level design documents from application ideas through GenAI prompting.

### 1.1 AI-Driven Document Generation
The DSL must support automatic generation through AI systems:
- Structure must be consistently parseable by AI
- Elements must have clear, unambiguous meanings
- Relationships must be explicitly defined
- Constraints must be machine-verifiable
- Output must be deterministic for same input

### 1.2 AI Prompt Requirements
The DSL must support a super prompt that can:
- Extract system purpose from app ideas
- Identify core business capabilities
- Determine system boundaries
- Suggest architectural patterns
- Define data strategies
- Derive non-functional requirements
- Generate consistent, valid DSL output

## 5. Example Structure

```
system ExampleSystem {
    purpose {
        vision: "Ultimate goal statement"
        mission: "What needs to be achieved"
        value {
            problem: "Problem description"
            solution: "Solution approach"
            beneficiaries: "Target users"
        }
    }

    capabilities {
        // Business capabilities definition
    }

    boundaries {
        // System boundaries definition
    }

    architecture {
        // Architectural decisions and patterns
    }

    data {
        // Data strategy definition
    }

    requirements {
        // Non-functional requirements
    }

    constraints {
        // System constraints
    }

    quality {
        // Quality attributes
    }
}
```

## 6. Success Criteria
