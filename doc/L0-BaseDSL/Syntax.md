## Overview

The Base DSL is designed to be a foundation for code generation across different levels of abstraction. It provides a common syntax and semantics for defining data structures, relationships, and validation rules.  The DSL uses a declarative approach, allowing users to specify *what* they want to achieve, rather than *how* to achieve it.  This promotes clarity, maintainability, and reusability of the code generation logic.  Furthermore, the Base DSL is extensible, enabling developers to adapt it to specific needs and integrate it with various tools and frameworks.  This adaptability ensures that the DSL remains relevant and valuable as technologies evolve.  Finally, the DSL is designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from novice developers to experienced engineers.  This accessibility encourages broader adoption and fosters a collaborative environment for code generation tasks.  By adhering to these principles, the Base DSL aims to empower developers to streamline their workflows, improve code quality, and accelerate the development process.

## 1. Document Structure

### 1.1 Basic Structure
```
@dsl v<version> {
    @metadata { ... }
    @types { ... }
    @sections { ... }
    @relationships { ... }
    @validation { ... }
}
```

### 1.2 Metadata Section
```
@metadata {
    name: string
    version: semver
    description: string
    author: string
    updated: date
    status: DRAFT | REVIEW | APPROVED
}

3. Property Definitions:
```
propertyName: {
    type: STRING | INTEGER | BOOLEAN | etc.
    required: true | false
    default: "<value>"
    validation: {
        // validation rules
    }
    description: "<description>"
}
```

5. Dependencies:
```
dependencies: {
    "<dependency>": {
        version: "<version-constraint>"
        required: true | false
    }
}
```
